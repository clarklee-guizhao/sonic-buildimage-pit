# PIT system of S3IP(Simplify Switch System Integration Program)

Brief
PIT is a sub-system, dedicated for the verification of white-box switch hardware, firmware, and driver.
PIT provides:
  *An automation test framework for platform hardware, firmware, and driver test;
  *A set of test cases written in platform-independent (CPU, ASIC, product) manner;
  *A set of platform APIs to provide hardware function abstraction (complementary to SONiC platform APIs), which help test case logic platform-independent.

Use scenario
  * Daily regression test in development stage(ODM + DC netowork users)
  * Manufacturing test in manufacture stage(ODM side)
  * Acceptance test in delivering stage(DC netowrk owner side)
